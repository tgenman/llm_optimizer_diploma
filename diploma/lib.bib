    abstractNote={Network modeling aims to learn the latent representations of nodes such that the representations preserve both network structures and node attribute information. This problem is fundamental due to its prevalence in numerous domains. However, existing approaches either target the static networks or struggle to capture the complicated temporal dependency, while most real-world networks evolve over time and the success of network modeling hinges on the understanding of how entities are temporally connected. In this paper, we present TRRN, a transformer-style relational reasoning network with dynamic memory updating, to deal with the above challenges. TRRN employs multi-head self-attention to reason over a set of memories, which provides a multitude of shortcut paths for information to flow from past observations to the current latent representations. By utilizing the policy networks augmented with differentiable binary routers, TRRN estimates the possibility of each memory being activated and dynamically updates the memories at the time steps when they are most relevant. We evaluate TRRN with the tasks of node classification and link prediction on four real temporal network datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the consistent performance gains for TRRN over the leading competitors.},

    abstract = 	 {At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.}
